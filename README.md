# 8,860,1.00 Machine Learning - Coding Labs

<!-- ![Course Banner](banner.png) -->

Dear Machine Learning course participants,

welcome to our 8,860,1.00 elective course **Machine Learning**, taught by **Prof. Dr. Damian Borth**. In this course, lectures and hands-on lab courses alternate to provide a better learning experience. The lab course materials for Python programming, Machine Learning und Deep Learning are available in and accessible through this repository.

Please use a laptop computer for the lab courses (not a tablet) to be able to fully participate in the exercises.

Happy Coding!

Your Machine Learning Teaching Team
